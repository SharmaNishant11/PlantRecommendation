# ⚙️ Installation

## 1 Install dependencies


pip install -r requirements.txt


---

## 2 Train the model


python train.py


This generates:


model/plant_model.pkl


---

## 3 Run the server


python app.py


Flask server will start:


http://localhost:5000


---

## 4 Open the dashboard

Open:


dashboard/index.html


in your browser.

---

# 📡 ESP32 Setup

Update the ESP32 code:


String serverName = "http://YOUR_PC_IP:5000/sensor";


Upload the code to your ESP32.

Sensor data will automatically stream to the server.

---
